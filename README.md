# Titanic-train-cleaned-data
This project is part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The goal of this task is to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

Project Overview
Cleaned missing and inconsistent data (e.g., replacing blanks with "null")

Extracted numeric values from mixed-format columns (like Ticket)

Identified duplicate Passenger IDs

Split and processed name strings into separate parts (e.g., Last Name, Title, Full Name)

Created pivot tables and visualizations to explore patterns

Visualizations & Analysis
Gender distribution (Pie Chart / Bar Chart)

Passenger class distribution

Age histogram

Survival rate by gender and class

Average fare by class

Files Included
titanic_cleaned.csv – Cleaned dataset used for EDA

titanic_charts.xlsx or .gsheet – Pivot tables & charts (if saved)

README.md – Project summary and steps followed

changelog.txt – Step-by-step documentation of the cleaning and analysis process

Tools Used
Google Sheets for data manipulation and visualization

Formulas (IF, COUNTIF, REGEXEXTRACT, IFERROR) for cleaning logic

Pivot tables and charts for EDA

Key Insights
Women had higher survival rates than men

1st-class passengers had better chances of survival

Most 3rd-class male passengers did not survive

Children had relatively better survival chances
